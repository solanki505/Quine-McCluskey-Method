# Quine-McCluskey-Method
## Quine-McCluskey Algorithm
This project implements the Quine-McCluskey algorithm (also known as the tabulation method) for minimizing boolean expressions. The algorithm takes as input the minterms and optional don't-care terms and produces the minimized Boolean expression in terms of prime implicants (PIs). It handles various edge cases, including cyclic PIs and semi-cyclic PIs, and displays the result in a tabular form for clarity.

## Features
### Handles all edge cases:
#### Cyclic Prime Implicants: 
Detects and manages PIs that form cyclic dependencies.
#### Semi-Cyclic Prime Implicants: 
Detects and handles PIs with partial cyclic relationships.
#### Tabular PI representation: 
Presents the prime implicants (PIs) and essential prime implicants (EPIs) in a clear, tabular format.
#### Efficient minimization: 
Optimizes boolean expressions by reducing the number of literals.
#### User-friendly interface: 
Easy-to-read output for educational purposes.
#### Edge Case Handling
1. Cyclic PIs
In cases where a set of PIs forms a cycle (e.g., A implies B, B implies C, and C implies A), the algorithm can still find the essential PIs by breaking the cycle and resolving the expressions.

2. Semi-Cyclic PIs
For semi-cyclic dependencies (where only a subset of PIs is involved in a partial cycle), the algorithm properly identifies and isolates the non-cyclic part while simplifying the cyclic portion efficiently.

3. Degenerate and Redundant Terms
The algorithm efficiently skips over redundant prime implicants and simplifies boolean expressions by recognizing and handling degenerate cases where no further reduction is possible.

Table Representation of Prime Implicants (PIs)
Once the algorithm has generated all prime implicants, the final step is to display them in a tabular form, which makes it easy to identify the essential PIs (EPIs) and visualize the coverage of minterms.

Minterm	Prime Implicant 1	Prime Implicant 2	Prime Implicant 3	...
0	1	0	1	...
1	1	1	0	...
2	0	1	1	...
...	...	...	...	...
1 in a cell indicates that the prime implicant covers the respective minterm.
Essential Prime Implicants (EPIs) are highlighted or marked for clarity.

Explanation:
The input specifies 4 variables and provides the minterms and don't-care terms.
The minterms and don't-care terms are grouped by the number of ones in their binary representation.
The PI Chart Matrix shows how each prime implicant (grouped by tuples of minterms) covers specific minterms.
The minimized Boolean expression is generated as the final result.
